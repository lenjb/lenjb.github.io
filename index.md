Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley. I am a development economist interested in urban/spatial economics, labor markets and gender. In my work, I combine empirical analysis with machine learning and remote sensing to be able to answer questions with a spatial component in contexts with little data.

Here you can find some information about me, my research and teaching experience.
