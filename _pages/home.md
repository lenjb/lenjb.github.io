      <p>I am a PhD Candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley. 

  <p>My research agenda is two-fold: focusing on urban development and how it affects labor markets in Sub-Saharan Africa, and secondly on gender dynamics and economic behavior in West Africa. In this research, I combine causal inference tools with machine learning and satellite imagery to deliver new insights on topics that have been so far little explored due to challenges around data availability. In my time at Berkeley, I also served as a Graduate Student Instructor for over five years and contributed to the UC Berkeley's D-Lab as a Data Science & AI Fellow (2023-2024).</p> 

  <p>Prior to my PhD, I also gained international research and policy experience as a Research Analyst at IFPRI, where I led data management and conducted quantitative analysis for impact evaluation projects in Mali and Burkina Faso, focusing on programs related to nutrition-sensitive cash transfers, childhood malnutrition and agriculture. I previously worked at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in France in the Higher Education Team within the Education Directorate and at the Experimentation Fund for Youth, carrying out social experimentations and impact evaluations to inform youth policy on behalf of the French government. My work is driven by a commitment to apply rigorous causal inference tools to generate actionable insights for policy and development. </p>
