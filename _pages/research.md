<div align="left" style="padding-left: 20px;line-height:15px"><p><small> I use convolutional neural networks with satellite imagery to evaluate the long-term impacts of World Bank Sites-and-Services housing projects in Kenya and Tanzania, 40-50 years after implementation in the 1960s-1970s. Using a difference-in-differences framework comparing project sites to neighboring wards, I find that Sites-and-Services had minimal impact on wealth: treatment was associated with changes in the asset-based wealth index ranging from 0 to 0.008 points. Strikingly, both treated and control areas experienced large declines in relative economic standing between the early (1978-1982) and later periods (1999-2003), with the small positive effect in Tanzania (0.008) coming entirely from treated areas declining less than control areas rather than from absolute improvements. I also test whether satellite imagery can predict social cohesion outcomes using Afrobarometer data, finding that existing methods cannot reliably predict multi-dimensional social outcomes (R² remains negative across specifications). These results suggest Sites-and-Services may help mitigate economic decline in struggling areas but are not engines of wealth creation, and demonstrate both the promise of satellite-based policy evaluation for concrete outcomes like housing quality and its current limitations for complex social outcomes. </small> </p>

	<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div align="left" style="padding-left: 20px;line-height:15px"><p><small> I test whether co-wife rivalry drives fertility up in polygynous households in Mali, using three waves of Demographic and Health Surveys (2006-2018) and following the methodology of Rossi (2018) who found strong competition effects in Senegal. Contrary to findings from Senegal, women in polygynous households in Mali have fewer children than those in monogamous marriages, with most of this difference driven by lower-ranked wives. First wives do not significantly reduce birth spacing after the entry of a second wife, showing little evidence of fertility competition between co-wives. Instead, the primary determinants of fertility are biological constraints—particularly age at marriage and length of reproductive periods—which disproportionately limit second wives who marry later. Social constraints, including limited female agency and restrictive gender norms, also appear to prevent women from treating fertility as a strategic choice variable. These findings suggest that in contexts where women lack decision-making power over reproduction, strategic fertility responses to household dynamics may be muted or impossible, with implications for how we model fertility decisions in settings with strong gender inequality. </small> </p>

<par><strong>Spatial mismatch and employment in Nigerian cities</strong></par>
<details style="margin-bottom:20px;padding-left: 40px;">
	<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div align="left" style="padding-left: 20px;line-height:15px"><p><small> I investigate whether poor urban spatial structure impedes labor market access in Nigerian cities by using city shape metrics as a proxy for transportation infrastructure quality, instrumenting with 1975 geography and projected population growth. Using administrative data from 98 cities (LSMS 2010, 2023) and primary survey data from 2,551 respondents across 13 cities (2025), I find that worse city shapes modestly reduce self-employment (0.23 percentage points for a one standard deviation increase in distortion) and increase commuting costs, but have minimal effects on overall labor force participation or hours worked. An alternative specification using instrumented distance to city center shows that living in cities with greater average distances increases self-employment by 0.37 percentage points but reduces formal employment by 0.24 percentage points, suggesting workers adjust to poor infrastructure by changing job types rather than leaving the labor market. I find no evidence that women are differentially affected by city shape, contrary to expectations about mobility constraints. The small magnitude of effects suggests that urban spatial structure in Nigerian cities affects employment composition more than employment levels, though weak instruments in some specifications limit causal interpretation. </small> </p>
